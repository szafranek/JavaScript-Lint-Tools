# JavaScript Lint Tools for TextMate 2

A bundle for validating JavaScript files with [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) and [JSLint](http://jslint.com/). To be minimally obtrusive validation results are displayed by default in a tooltip. You can override that behavior in bundle configuration.

Three commands are provided:

* `Lint on Save`. Invoked automatically when saving a JavaScript file using `Cmd`+`S`. The file will be validated only if it starts with a comment used to select the linter: `/*jshint*/` or `/*jslint*/`. The usual syntax to provide linting options is supported, e.g. `/*jslint white, for */`.
* `Validate with JSHint`. Invokes JSHint explicitly.
* `Validate with JSLint`. Invokes JSLint explicitly.

## Installation

```
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Pristine\ Copy/Bundles
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Pristine\ Copy/Bundles
git clone git@github.com:szafranek/JavaScript-Lint-Tools.git "JavaScript Lint Tools.tmbundle"
```

The bundle uses node.js and requires `node` command to be present in your `PATH`.

## Credits

This bundle started originally as a fork of Adam Craven's [bundle](https://github.com/AdamCraven/JavaScript-Lint-tools.tmbundle) for TextMate 1.
